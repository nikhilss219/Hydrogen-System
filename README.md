# ReaxFF-Energy-Calculations

REAXFF PROGRAM to calculate the total energy values of different system.
I have created this program for the theoretical calculations which are necessary for calculating various partial energies which contribute to the total energy of the system according to the ReaxFF program.
The program varies the interatomic distance of the system and calculates the energies at all the different points and then uses the matplotlib python module to plot the graph as the outcome. The terminal window will also output the value of the energy as a table.
Currently we have three systems which are Hydrogen, Ethane and Ethylene.
